// This test file has been deprecated and replaced by the new architecture:
// - CheckpointStateManager (stateful service)
// - CheckpointCoordinator (stateless service)  
// - checkpoint-serializer.ts (tool functions)
//
// The old CheckpointManager mixed responsibilities across different architectural layers
// and has been refactored to follow proper separation of concerns.
